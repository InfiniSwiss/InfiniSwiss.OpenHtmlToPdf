# InfiniSwiss.OpenHtmlToPdf
A small library for converting HTML strings to Pdf using wkhtmltopdf adapted from OpenHtmlToPdf to use a newer version of wkhtmltopdf and to work with dotnet standard.

# Note
This library doesn't always produce 1:1 fidelity with printing from the browser. If you run your application in an environment where a Chromium-based browser is installed (Chrome, Edge etc) consider using https://github.com/InfiniSwiss/InfiniSwiss.ChromiumHtmlToPdf instead.
